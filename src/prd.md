### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Complementary (dark background with vibrant accents)
**Primary Color**: Deep blue-purple (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - professional and tech-focused
**Secondary Colors**: Soft purple-gray (oklch(0.85 0.08 280)) - supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Bright cyan-green (oklch(0.65 0.18 180)) - highlights and active states
**Color Psychology**: Dark theme conveys professionalism, accent colors suggest innovation and energy

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold titles (700), medium subtitles (600), regular body (400)
**Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible for technical content
**Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing, appropriate contrast ratios
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
**Legibility Check**: Inter is highly optimized for screen reading

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Header → Upload → Processing Steps → Results
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between major sections for clarity
**Grid System**: Responsive grid adapting from 1 column (mobile) to 4 columns (desktop)
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle hover effects and processing indicators
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Processing steps get visual priority during active states
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animation to maintain professional feel

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for major content sections
- Buttons for actions (primary/secondary/outline variants)
- Dialog for API configuration
- Tabs for organized results viewing
- Progress indicators for processing steps
- Badges for status communication

**Component States**: All interactive elements have proper hover, active, disabled, and loading states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for consistent style and comprehensive coverage
**Spacing System**: Tailwind's spacing scale for mathematical precision

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
**Color Accessibility**: Status communicated through both color and text/icons

## Implementation Considerations

### RunPod Integration
- Base64 image encoding for API submission
- Job polling for asynchronous processing
- Proper error handling for API failures


### State Management
- Persistent API credentials using useKV
- Processing state management for UI updates
- Generated content organization and access

### Error Handling

- Processing failure recovery


## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Network connectivity issues during processing
- Invalid API credentials
- Processing job failures



- Validation before processing starts

- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
