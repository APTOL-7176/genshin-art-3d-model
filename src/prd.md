**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with progressive disclosure - simple for beginners, powerful for experts

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous (cool blues and purples with warm accent colors)
**Primary Color**: Deep purple-blue (`oklch(0.45 0.15 260)`) - represents technology and creativity
**Secondary Colors**: Light purple-grays for cards and interfaces
**Accent Color**: Bright electric blue for processing states and call-to-action elements
**Color Psychology**: Cool colors convey professionalism and technology, while warm accents provide energy and interactivity
**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Background white (`oklch(1.00 0 0)`) with dark text (`oklch(0.10 0.005 240)`) - 21:1 contrast
- Primary purple buttons with white text - 9.2:1 contrast  
- Card backgrounds with subtle gradients for depth while maintaining accessibility

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI elements (clean, technical), JetBrains Mono for code/technical data
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Large headings (32px) for page titles
- Medium headings (24px) for section titles  
- Body text (16px) with 1.5 line height for readability
- Small text (14px) for metadata and secondary information
**Font Personality**: Modern, clean, and highly legible with technical precision
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing scale using Tailwind's type system
**Which fonts**: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (monospace)
**Legibility Check**: All fonts tested for clarity at various sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
