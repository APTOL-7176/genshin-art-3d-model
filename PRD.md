## Color Selection
Custom palette with anime-inspired colors that reflect Genshin Impact's visual style.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Azure Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Conveys magical transformation and technical precision
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Soft Lavender (oklch(0.85 0.08 280)) for supporting UI elements
  - Warm Gold (oklch(0.75 0.12 85)) for accent highlights and success states
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Teal (oklch(0.65 0.18 180)) for CTAs and progress indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Deep Navy #1a1b2e): Light text (oklch(0.95 0.02 240)) - Ratio 12.5:1 ✓
  - Card (Midnight Blue #252648): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Azure #3d5af1): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Teal #2dd4bf): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.02 240)) - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Modern, clean typefaces that convey technical precision while maintaining approachability for creative workflows.


  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing

  - H3 (Feature Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing

  - Captions (Status text): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations
Smooth, purposeful animations that emphasize the magical transformation process and provide clear feedback for technical operations.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates the transformation journey from pixel art to 3D model
