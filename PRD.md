- **Trigger**: User selects and uploads pixel art file
- **Progression**: File selection → Upload → Style conversion → Preview generated image
- **Success criteria**: Original pixel art successfully transformed into Genshin Impact visual style

### T-Pose Generation
- **Functionality**: Convert character poses to T-pose format for 3D modeling
- **Purpose**: Standardize character poses for optimal 3D model generation
- **Trigger**: User initiates T-pose conversion on processed image
- **Progression**: Select processed image → T-pose conversion → Generate front/side/back views
- **Success criteria**: Character pose normalized to T-pose with proper proportions

### Multi-View Generation
- **Functionality**: Create front, side, and back view images from T-pose
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive reference images for 3D model creation
- **Trigger**: T-pose conversion completion
- **Progression**: T-pose image → Multi-angle processing → Generate 3 view angles → Display results
- **Success criteria**: Three consistent view angles showing character from all sides

### 3D Model Creation
- **Functionality**: Process multi-view images into fully textured 3D model
- **Purpose**: Create final 3D asset suitable for game engines or 3D software
- **Trigger**: User initiates 3D model generation with completed multi-view images
- **Progression**: Multi-view images → 3D processing → Model generation → Download ready file
- **Success criteria**: Downloadable 3D model file with proper textures and geometry

### RunPod API Integration
- **Functionality**: Connect to RunPod API using user-provided credentials
- **Purpose**: Leverage cloud GPU processing for image and 3D model generation
- **Trigger**: User enters API key and endpoint in settings
- **Progression**: Enter credentials → Validate connection → Enable processing features
- **Success criteria**: Successful API connection with processing capabilities enabled

## Edge Case Handling
- **Invalid API credentials**: Clear error messages with credential validation guidance
- **Upload file format errors**: Support common image formats with format conversion suggestions
- **Processing failures**: Retry mechanisms with detailed error reporting
- **Large file handling**: Progress indicators and file size optimization
- **Network timeouts**: Graceful degradation with offline mode indicators

## Design Direction
The interface should feel cutting-edge and magical, reflecting the high-quality transformation from simple pixel art to sophisticated 3D models, with a clean, professional aesthetic that inspires confidence in the processing capabilities.

## Color Selection
Custom palette with anime-inspired colors that reflect Genshin Impact's visual style.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Azure Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Conveys magical transformation and technical precision
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Soft Lavender (oklch(0.85 0.08 280)) for supporting UI elements
  - Warm Gold (oklch(0.75 0.12 85)) for accent highlights and success states
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Teal (oklch(0.65 0.18 180)) for CTAs and progress indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Deep Navy #1a1b2e): Light text (oklch(0.95 0.02 240)) - Ratio 12.5:1 ✓
  - Card (Midnight Blue #252648): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Azure #3d5af1): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Vibrant Teal #2dd4bf): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.02 240)) - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Modern, clean typefaces that convey technical precision while maintaining approachability for creative workflows.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Feature Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Instructions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Captions (Status text): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations
Smooth, purposeful animations that emphasize the magical transformation process and provide clear feedback for technical operations.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates the transformation journey from pixel art to 3D model
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Processing states get primary animation focus, with subtle hover effects on secondary elements
